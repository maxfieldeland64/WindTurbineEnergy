# Predicting Energy Output from Wind Turbine based on real time weather conditions 

* ## Introduction:
  Utilities and renewable energy market entrepreneurs require weather dependent electrical power forecasts. Historic electrical forecasts are based on ideal weather and machinery conditions, such as constant periodic wind patterns. A precise energy forecast can overcome problems of variable energy production caused by fluctuating weather and wind conditions.
  

* ## Objective:
    Estimate models to predict the energy output of wind turbines in 10 minute intervals based on current weather conditions
